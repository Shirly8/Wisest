Forget magic 8 balls or randomized choosers! What about real calculated decisions based on statistics and your own needs? Wisest is there for you through difficult times (Deciding on job offers, universities, or cities to move to), through the good times (Decising on a restaurant, or vacation destination), or through the daily times (Picking a movie, or clothes), Wisest is always there!

## Features
- **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis**: Wisest allows you to input multiple options and evaluate them based on various criteria. This way, your informed decision considers all factors.

- **Optimal Conditions**: For each category, you can specify whether a higher value, lower value, 'Yes', 'No', or rank is optimal. Wisest's flexibility can adapt to any decision-making scenario.

- **Metrics System**: Wisests lets you enter any metrics and values as you wish. Whether its ranking a decision on a scale of 10, to selecting Yes/No buttons to enter any numerical values. 

- **Rankings**: After inputting all your metrics, you can assign a preference ranking to each category. This helps you weigh the importance of each factor in your decision.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: With its intuitive design, Wisest is easy to use. Just input your options, set your criteria, input your metrics and category ranking, and let Wisest do the rest!

-**Accurate Calculation**: Wisest is simple! Its algorithm normalizes the metrics, inverse the metrics (if lower is better), and calculates the scores for each option by adding the product of the normalized metric. Finally, Wisest weighs the choices based on the category's importance. This ensures that each option is evaluated fairly and based on what you think is important to you!
