- **Metrics System**: Wisests lets you enter any metrics and values as you wish. Whether its ranking a decision on a scale to 10, to selecting Yes/No buttons to entering any numerical values.

-**Accurate Calculation**: Wisest is simple! It's algorithm normalizes the metrics, invers the metrics (if lower is better) and calculates the scores for each option by adding the product of the normalized metric.
